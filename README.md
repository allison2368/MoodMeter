# MoodMeter

This project will be a mobile application to implement the Mood Meter designed by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. Teaching emotional intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ) is often overlooked in K-12 curriculum, however, research has proven that improved EQ leads to increased performance and efficiency in the classroom. Students also have greater confidence in their leadership skills inside and outside the classroom. Mood Meter is a practical tool meant to carry out a research-based method called RULER, or Recognizing emotions in oneself and others, Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions, Labeling emotions with a nuanced vocabulary, Expressing emotions in accordance with cultural norms and social context, Regulating emotions with helpful strategies.
